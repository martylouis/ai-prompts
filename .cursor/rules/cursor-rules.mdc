# Cursor Project Rules Standards

## Rule Structure

- Use proper frontmatter with metadata
- Include clear descriptions and glob patterns
- Follow Cursor's rule format specifications
- Reference files using `[filename](mdc:filename)` syntax

## Metadata Requirements

- `alwaysApply`: Set to true for global rules, false for specific ones
- `description`: Clear description for rule discovery
- `globs`: Gitignore-style patterns for file matching
- Use only one metadata type per rule when possible

## Content Guidelines

- Write clear, actionable instructions
- Use markdown formatting for better readability
- Include examples where helpful
- Reference relevant documentation
- Keep rules focused and specific

## File Organization

- Store all rules in `.cursor/rules/` directory
- Use descriptive file names
- Group related rules together
- Maintain consistent naming conventions
- Document rule dependencies and interactions

## Best Practices

- Test rules in actual Cursor environment
- Keep rules concise and focused
- Update rules when project structure changes
- Document rule purposes and intended effects
- Avoid conflicting or redundant rules
