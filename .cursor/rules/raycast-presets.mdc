# Raycast Presets Development

## JSON Structure Requirements

Presets must be valid JSON arrays containing preset objects with:

- `name`: Human-readable preset name
- `instructions`: The system prompt/instructions
- `model`: AI model specification
- `creativity`: Creativity level setting
- `reasoning_effort`: Reasoning effort level
- `tools`: Array of available tools
- `web_search`: Boolean for web search capability

## Content Standards

- Instructions should follow the format: Identity → Instructions → Examples → Context
- Include clear identity definition for the AI role
- Provide specific, actionable instructions
- Include relevant examples with `<example>` tags
- Add context about the AI's expertise and capabilities

## Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive, kebab-case filenames
- Names should clearly indicate the AI's specialization
- Examples: `technical-writer.json`, `system-level-prompt-architect.json`

## Quality Guidelines

- Ensure instructions are clear and actionable
- Test presets in actual Raycast environment
- Maintain consistency with other presets in the library
- Include appropriate tool configurations for the AI's role
