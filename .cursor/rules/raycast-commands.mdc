# Raycast Commands Development

## Structure Requirements

- Every JSON command must have a corresponding MD documentation file
- JSON files must be valid JSON arrays containing command objects
- MD files should include examples, usage instructions, and context

## JSON Command Format

Commands must include these required fields:

- `title`: Human-readable command name
- `prompt`: The actual prompt text
- `model`: AI model specification
- `creativity`: Creativity level setting
- `highlightEdits`: Boolean for edit highlighting

## Documentation Standards

- MD files should follow the format: Identity → Instructions → Examples → Context
- Include at least 2-3 usage examples with `<example>` tags
- Provide clear context about when and how to use the command
- Use consistent terminology and formatting

## File Organization

- Keep JSON and MD files in parallel directories
- Use descriptive, kebab-case filenames
- Maintain consistent structure across all commands
