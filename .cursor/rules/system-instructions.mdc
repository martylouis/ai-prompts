# System Instructions Development

## Content Structure

All system instruction files must follow this format:

1. **Identity**: Clear definition of the AI's role and expertise
2. **Instructions**: Specific, actionable guidance for the AI
3. **Examples**: Practical examples with `<example>` tags
4. **Context**: Additional context about capabilities and use cases

## Writing Standards

- Use clear, professional language
- Provide specific, actionable instructions
- Include multiple examples covering different scenarios
- Structure content with clear headings and sections
- Use consistent formatting and terminology

## Quality Guidelines

- Test instructions in actual Cursor environment
- Ensure instructions are comprehensive but concise
- Include error handling and edge case considerations
- Maintain consistency with other system instructions
- Focus on practical, real-world usage scenarios

## File Organization

- Use descriptive, kebab-case filenames
- Names should clearly indicate the AI's specialization
- Examples: `code-reviewer.md`, `technical-writer.md`, `prd-generator.md`

## Content Requirements

- Minimum 50 lines of substantive content
- Include at least 2-3 detailed examples
- Provide clear context about when to use the instruction
- Ensure instructions are self-contained and complete
